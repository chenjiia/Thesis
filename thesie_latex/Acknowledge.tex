\vskip 10mm % Edit everything below with your acknowledging text.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Dr.Rohit Chadha, for guiding me through the research process when I was working on the previous thesis subject of browser cross-site scripting defence, and furthermore for providing me the current subject when I was struggling with the previous one. He helped me all the way during research and writing of this thesis, with his deep knowledge on information security.

I also sincerely give my appreciation to Dr.Prasad Calyam and Dr.Michela Becchi, for their time and work serving as my thesis committee members.

I'd like to thank Umang Mathur for providing MOPED source code and building instructions during the tests. His email saved us plenty of time. 

Last but not the least, I would like to thank my parents and friends, for encouraging me to fight on.
