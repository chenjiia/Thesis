\chapter{Monotonic programs}
	\label{CH_04}
	
In this chapter we describe our discovery that if the test program $P$ is monotonic, then we can execute the program wrapped in algorithm \ref{alg:doubleLoop} and get a direct output count in a reasonable time.

\section{Discovery by mistake}
During the initial tests with the sanity check program of bit length 32, we code algorithm \ref{alg:doubleLoop} in C using while instead of for, compile it and execute the program. The program terminates in less than a minute, and gives the correct output count. Later we time the execution of an empty loop from $0$ to $2^{32} - 1$ and the result is $10.30$ seconds, so theoretically the double loop would take a much longer time to terminate, longer than our test result with sanity check.
